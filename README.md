# Homework2

For part1

I just made the solution that each "guest will tell the minotaur when they ate the cupcake" The minotaur will stop after all guests talk to it.

For part2

Strategy1 I dont see advantages to this one as it might brake the vase so no way implmenting 

Strategy2 advantage seems to be flexible however if the guests are around the castle and some might not get to see the vase but it is probably the second best option

Strategy3 This everybody gets to see the vase and one person around the vase only the only problem is that the guests might not wander around freely but everybody gets to see the vase. (I used this one)
